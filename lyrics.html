        Yeah, yeah
        Mmm, yeah
        Lit it up, I'm the one that's feeling on fire (It's lit)
        Live it up, looking at my G, we go higher
        I earned the whole shit, hope you're hearing that
        Come at man and I'll make a man go
        Flowing my riches, making wishes
        For all these bitches, yeah
        Haters so vicious, making riches
        In all these cities, yeah
        Hate going shopping, people popping
        For all these pictures, yeah
        Say that I'm flopping, still you copping
        So why you knocking at my door?
        I don't care about what you 'Wanna Do', I just ignore
        You can't keep on charging like a bull, I'm at the door
        I'ma dress up how I fucking like, it's my decor
        I'ma fuck up how I fucking like (Wait)
        Nigga I'm independent, no one talking that condescending
        Say that my time is ending, still I kill it and go and send it
        I'm in control, doing shit you don't know
        I'm ascending, living, winning, moving like I'm J.Cole (And)
        I can do what I want, I can do what I want (Mmm)
        I can do what I want and no one, no one here stopping me (Na)
        No one, noone here stopping me (Na)
        Gotta let them know I'm uncontrollable
        I'm ruling when they roll with me
        I done let them know I'm uncontrollable
        Being who I wanna be (Yeah, yeah)
        No way, no way, no way, no way, no way you're controlling me
        No way, no way, no way, no way, no way, you're not owning me
        I don't wanna know, I'm here with the dough
        Counting all the blessings and I live it all fo' sho'

        See I'm something that you can't control
        They don't want to see me mad, that they can't control
        I make moves and tell my accountant roll
        I ain't part of the system, I can't enroll
        Said I'm due to blow, like when the blast implodes
        From the inside out, man I keep it real
        I can tell that they're fake, but I can't expose
        And I've got that drive, I don't need that gas
        Man I'm something like the cars that charge on road
        I'm in hearts, I'm in master mode
        Hustler by nature, can't you hear my grafter tone?
        Won't stop 'til the Shard's my home
        It's the B-I-G, man are bigger than a barge
        Man talk bad and they're getting on my nerves
        They used to say reason with the work
        Man I never could compromise for how much I'm getting for a verse
        I bet they're all regretting all their words
        Try war man, I'll send him in a hearse
        From a ends where bruddas bust weapons and they skr
        Said I see it as a blessing and a curse
        It made me diverse when I've been through worse
        But now they can't fuck with the plans
        Man are happy where I am now I'm finishing first
        Yeah, and I'm making moves
        I don't care for hating Zuu
        I'll start hotting up kids like real quick start blazing youtes
        You'll see bare gun fingers but there won't be no raving crew
        Man have been one of the best, I can't lie, it's the blatant truth
        And I can show them evidence
        It's black and white like the change of Presidents
        Man are big 'ere like the side of elephants
        You're talking bare with your big mouth
        You sound like a bird you pelican
        I don't really care about relevance
        Like if they don't know then I'm telling them
        I'll put their favourite MC in the grave and bury them
        Guess what I've got accumulating
        Send shots to any crew that's hating
        Flex gods, MTP formation
        Walk in the rave, we don't need no creditation
        I don't really care about the pagans
        I can see the devils in their words
        It's a man who they're demonstrating
        Oh you didn't catch that bar?
        Well guess what, that's 'cause I'm steps ahead
        I don't play with dough but still I stretch the bread
        Like, tryna get the full package
        Like the back's nice but the breasts are dead
        Couple Park guys but the rest are dreads
        That I take your girl, that's once she left your bed
        And now you're vexed and stressed
        Man are breaking hearts so protect your chest, like

        I can do what I want, I can do what I want (Mmm)
        I can do what I want and no one, no one here stopping me
        No one, no one here stopping me

        Gotta let 'em know I'm uncontrollable
        I'm ruling when they roll with me
        I done let them know I'm uncontrollable
        Being who I wanna be (Yeah, yeah)
        No way, no way, no way, no way, no way you're controlling me
        No way, no way, no way, no way, no way, you're not owning me
        I don't wanna know, I'm here with the dough
        Counting all the blessings and I live it all fo' sho'
